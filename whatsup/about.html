        <h1 class="header"> Who are the What's Up Counsellors? </h1>
        <h1 class="blurb"> When you call or chat online with us you will be talking to one of our What’s Up Counsellors – they are really great at listening and always interested to hear what is going on for you.
        You can ask to speak with a guy or girl counsellor, and if you have spoken with a counsellor before you can even ask to speak to the same person if you want to! Our counsellors work all different times and days, so when you talk to them just ask them when they are on next so you know the best time to get in touch. 
        Even though you don’t have to tell us your name, our counsellors will always tell you theirs, and if they are not available when you call you can find out when they will be just by asking.</br></br>

         Who can call and chat online? 
         0800 What’s Up is for young New Zealanders aged between 5 and 18.  If you don’t fit into this group there are still lots of services available to help you with all sorts of things. Check out https://www.familyservices.govt.nz/directory/ </br></br>

         Does it cost any money to call, text or chat online?
         It’s free to get in touch with us any way you like – even through a mobile phone. 
        And you don’t even need to have credit to do it!  If you are stuck somewhere and don’t have a mobile phone you can also call on any landline, or from any phone booth </h1>
